Lore
The card game is from a shuttered table top gaming company called Triumvirate Gaming (reference to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Triumvirate). The game, released in 1999, was their first and only launch and was a commercial failure. The owner vanished after the company was dissolved. A string of suicides and disappearances on part of the employees has been swept under some unknown rug. 

Gai is a 26-year-old who has been working at their dream company for 3 years, but never in their dream role; they are a business development representative, although they want to be on the production team. After an embarrassing interaction with the Product team (detailed in the blog), Gai fails to prove their abilities and is told to stick to their role. Envious and bitter, Gai begins to vandalize cards before they are boxed and shipped.
